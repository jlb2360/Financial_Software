# Retirement Monte Carlo Simulator

This tool is a Python-based **Monte Carlo Simulator** designed to stress-test financial independence plans. Unlike traditional linear calculators, this script accounts for "Sequence of Returns Risk" by simulating 100,000 different economic paths based on market volatility and inflation.

## Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed along with the `numpy` library:
```bash
pip install numpy
```
### 2. Preprae your Data (plan.jsonc)

Create a JSON file (comments are supported) with your financial details

```plan.jsonc
{
    "CURRENT AGE": 35,
    "PORTFOLIO": {
        "CURRENT": 200000,        // Starting investment balance
        "MONTHLY DEPOSIT": 2500,  // Monthly savings during your career
        "ANNUAL DIVIDENDS": 4000  // Initial annual passive income
    },
    "RETIREMENT": {
        "RETIREMENT AGE": 65,
        "DEATH AGE": 95,          // The end point for the simulation
        "ANNUAL SPEND": 100000,    // Target yearly budget (inflated over time)
        "SOCIAL SECURITY": 30000, // Estimated annual benefit at retirement
        "EMERGENCY SAVINGS": 3    // Number of "bad years" you can survive without selling stocks
    }
}

```

### 3. Run the Simulation

Execute the script via the command line, passing your plan file as an argument:

```bash
python sim.py plan.jsonc
```

### 4. Interpret Results

**Expected**: This is simply using the market historical returns. A plan which has an expected success rate of 85% to 92% is considered a good plan.
If you are above 92% it is recommended that you are sacrificing to much of your current lifestyle for your future.
If you are below 85% you are not on track and should consider increasing the amount you save for your future or extend working years.

**Conservative**: This is a test to see if your retirement plan can weather a rough patch during retirment where inflation is higher and equity returns are lower. This plan should have a success rate of around 70% to 80%.

**Catastrophic**: This is a worst case scenario or a "lost decade" in the stock market. This plan should have a success rate of around 50%.


***Author's Note***: The success rate for conservative and catastrophic simulations may be artificially lower if you are young. These should only be trusted as you start truly plannig for retirement say around 10 years before retirment.

## 🧠 Core Logic

The simulator moves beyond simple "straight-line" math to provide a realistic look at financial outcomes.

### 1. Stochastic Market Modeling
Instead of assuming a static growth rate (e.g., a flat 7% every year), the engine uses a **Normal Distribution** to sample a different market return for every single year of the simulation. This accounts for the "random walk" of the stock market.

$$Annual\ Return = \text{np.random.normal}(\mu, \sigma)$$

* **$\mu$ (Mean):** The average expected return (e.g., 0.10 for 10%).
* **$\sigma$ (Standard Deviation):** The volatility or "swing" of the market (e.g., 0.15 for 15%).

### 2. Sequence of Returns Risk & "Emergency Skips"
The greatest threat to a retiree is a market crash occurring immediately after they stop working. This script models a defensive strategy:

* **Negative Year Check:** If the simulated market return is negative ($< 0\%$), the simulator checks the `emergency_skips` counter.
* **The "Skip" Action:** If skips are available, the retiree does **not** sell portfolio assets that year. This allows the portfolio to remain untouched during a downturn, preventing the permanent loss of capital that occurs when selling in a bear market.
* **Depletion:** Once the emergency skips are exhausted, the retiree must withdraw funds regardless of market performance.



### 3. Compounded Inflation & Raises
The simulation tracks three different moving variables to ensure purchasing power is maintained:
* **Contributions:** Grow annually by the `annual_raise` percentage.
* **Spending:** The `annual_spend` is adjusted upward every year based on the `inflation_rate`.
* **Social Security & Dividends:** These are also adjusted for inflation to simulate Cost of Living Adjustments (COLA).

## Customization

You can modify the economic assumptions (returns, inflation, and raises) directly within the Scenario list in the **main()** function of **sim.py**
